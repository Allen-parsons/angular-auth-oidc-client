# Version 13 to 14

## Removed `APP_INITIALIZER`

In this version we removed the `APP_INITIALIZER` ([See PR](https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client/pull/1307)).

The library now does nothing until you interact with her. No loading of anything and it does not affect your applications bootstrapping process at all.

You can however explicitly preload your Auth Well-Known Endpoints with a new method called [preloadAuthWellKnownDocument](/docs/documentation/public-api#preloadauthwellknowndocumentconfigid-string)
